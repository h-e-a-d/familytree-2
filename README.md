## Project Overview

MapMyRoots is a free online family tree builder and genealogy software built with vanilla JavaScript. It features a canvas-based interactive family tree visualization with drag-and-drop functionality, multi-format export capabilities, and comprehensive person management.

# Workflows

This is a collection of workflows. When the user tells you to use one of these workflows YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL STEPS in the outlined order.

An example of the user specifying what workflow to use:
workflow: standard. <task description comes afterwards>

## Standard

This is the most commonly used workflow and should be your default if in doubt.

Do not start implementing the task without explicitly being told by the user to do so.

1.  Think hard about the task given (collect context and get deep understanding)
2.  Ask the user questions if you have any doubts
3.  Generate a plan for how to implement the task and save it to a file called task.md. Once you have saved your plan, provide the user with a 2-3 line summary of the plan and of your understanding of the task. It's VERY important to give the user opportunity to correct both the plan and understanding.

## Prepared Task

This is used when there is a complete task outline in a task file the user will point you to.

1. Examine the content of the task file
2. Think hard about it and investigate files to gather context
3. Ask any questions you might have
4. Provide the user with a short summary of your understanding for approval BEFORE beginning
5. Implement the prepared task once approval is given from user

## Recent Security & Architecture Improvements (2024)

The codebase has been significantly enhanced with critical improvements:

- **Security**: All `innerHTML` usage replaced with safe DOM manipulation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data sanitization for user inputs
- **Architecture**: Event-driven system replacing window globals
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and recovery strategies
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Configuration**: Centralized config system with feature flags
- **Code Organization**: Modal styles separated into dedicated CSS file for better maintainability
- **Legacy Code Removal**: Cleaned up all legacy data format support for simplified codebase

## Recent Refactoring (December 2024)

### Modal System Refactoring
- **Separated modal styles**: Extracted all modal-related CSS from `style.css` into dedicated `modal.css`
- **Improved maintainability**: Modal styles are now organized in a single file
- **Updated references**: `builder.html` now includes both `style.css` and `modal.css`
- **Clean separation**: Main stylesheet no longer contains modal-specific code

### Legacy Code Removal
- **Removed legacy data format support**: Application now only supports current JSON format
- **Cleaned JavaScript**: Removed `processLegacyData()` and `checkForLegacyData()` methods
- **Updated error handling**: Unrecognized data formats are now properly rejected
- **Simplified notifications**: Removed legacy-specific notification types
- **Cleaned HTML**: Removed legacy import modal and related UI elements
- **Updated translations**: Removed legacy-related translations from all locale files

### Smart Node Positioning Fix
- **Fixed coordinate mismatch issue**: New nodes now appear at screen center for immediate visibility
- **Center-screen placement**: New nodes are positioned at the current viewport center with small offsets
- **Auto-camera centering**: Camera automatically centers on loaded JSON content when no saved position
- **Better user experience**: New nodes always appear in the user's current view

### Critical Bug Fixes (December 2024)
- **Button State Management Conflict**: Fixed critical issue where multiple button management systems conflicted
- **Permanent Button Disabling**: Resolved bug where Save/Delete buttons became disabled after one use
- **Conflicting State Systems**: Disabled automatic button enhancement that competed with modal.js management
- **Comprehensive Button Reset**: Added button state reset on modal open/close to prevent state corruption
- **Race Condition Fix**: Eliminated timing conflicts between different button loading state managers
- **UI Reliability**: Ensured all modal buttons work consistently without requiring page refresh

### Modal UX/UI Redesign (December 2024)
- **Complete Modal Redesign**: Completely redesigned Add Person and Edit Person modals with modern UI patterns
- **Enhanced Button System**: Implemented three-tier button design with gradients, animations, and proper hierarchy
- **Mobile-First Layout**: Optimized modal layout for mobile devices with compact single-row button arrangement
- **Modern Form Design**: Enhanced form fields with progressive animations, improved spacing, and better visual hierarchy
- **Confirmation Modal Enhancement**: Redesigned delete/clear confirmations with visual impact and clear consequence lists
- **ModalUXEnhancer Conflict Resolution**: Fixed CSS conflicts where ui-modals.js automatic enhancement interfered with custom modal.css styles
- **CSS Specificity Management**: Prevented inline style conflicts by exempting personModal from automatic enhancement
- **Responsive Design**: Comprehensive mobile optimization with proper touch targets and compact layouts

### Recent Critical Fixes (January 2025)

#### Export System Improvements
- **Outline Export Fix**: Fixed "Show outline" feature not applying to exported files (PNG, SVG, PDF)
  - **Issue**: Canvas export methods ignored `showNodeOutline` setting, always drawing outlines
  - **Solution**: Updated `drawCircleNodeExport()` and `drawRectangleNodeExport()` methods in `canvas-renderer.js:276-308` to respect outline settings
  - **SVG Export**: Made SVG styling conditional based on `window.treeCore.renderer.settings.showNodeOutline`
  - **Result**: Exported files now match browser display exactly for outline visibility

- **Connection Lines Export Restoration**: Fixed connection lines disappearing in exports after outline fix
  - **Issue**: `drawConnectionsOnly()` method used hardcoded colors instead of user settings
  - **Solution**: Updated method to match browser display logic with proper line styles, colors, and thickness
  - **Pattern Applied**: Used same pattern as outline fix - export methods now mirror browser display settings
  - **Result**: Both outlines and connection lines export correctly with user's configured appearance

#### Connection Modal Implementation
- **Link Modal Functionality**: Implemented complete connection modal system for relationship creation
  - **Missing Functions**: Added `setupConnectionModal()`, `openConnectionModal()`, `closeConnectionModal()`, `createConnectionWithType()`, `createLineOnlyConnection()` methods
  - **Modal Integration**: Connected existing HTML/CSS structure with JavaScript functionality
  - **Relationship Types**: Full support for Mother, Father, Child, Spouse, and Line-only connections
  - **User Experience**: Personalized modal text showing actual person names, proper notifications
  - **Event Handling**: Modal closes on cancel, outside click, with proper state cleanup

- **Line-Only Connection Fix**: Resolved line-only connections not being drawn
  - **Root Cause**: Parameter handling error - functions expected person IDs but received objects
  - **Fix**: Corrected `createConnectionWithType()` to pass IDs directly instead of `personA.id`
  - **Data Flow**: `handleConnectSelected()` â†’ modal functions now handle IDs correctly
  - **Result**: Line-only connections now draw properly between selected people

#### Cache Indicator User Experience
- **Auto-Close Prevention**: Fixed cache indicator closing immediately when trying to edit tree name
  - **Issue 1**: Input field clicks triggered parent element's toggle function
  - **Solution 1**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to input field and expanded content event handlers
  - **Issue 2**: Auto-collapse timer continued despite user interaction
  - **Solution 2**: Added `clearCollapseTimer()` method with comprehensive event handling
  - **Interaction Events**: Clear timer on click, focus, input, keydown events
  - **Smart Timing**: Only auto-close 2 seconds after losing focus, with hover protection
  - **Result**: Panel stays open reliably while actively editing tree name

### Export Rendering Architecture

The application now uses a **dual rendering system** that ensures visual consistency:

#### Browser Display Rendering
- **Location**: `canvas-renderer.js` methods like `drawConnections()`, `drawCircleNode()`, `drawRectangleNode()`
- **Features**: Full user preference support, complex styling, UI state awareness
- **Settings Used**: `showNodeOutline`, `outlineColor`, `outlineThickness`, line style settings

#### Export Rendering  
- **Location**: `canvas-renderer.js` export methods like `drawConnectionsOnly()`, `drawCircleNodeExport()`, `drawRectangleNodeExport()`
- **Pattern**: Mirror browser display logic but with simplified, export-optimized rendering
- **Consistency**: Export methods now respect the same user settings as browser display
- **Formats**: Applies to PNG, SVG, PDF exports through canvas and SVG generation

#### SVG Export Styling
- **Dynamic CSS**: `exporter.js` generates conditional CSS based on current renderer settings
- **Outline Support**: `stroke: ${outlineColor}` or `stroke: none` based on `showNodeOutline`
- **Settings Access**: Uses `window.treeCore.renderer.settings` for live configuration
- **Element Types**: Supports both circle and rectangle node styles

### Connection Modal System Architecture

#### HTML Structure (`builder.html:150-165`)
```html
<div id="connectionModal" class="modal hidden">
  <div class="modal-content connection-content">
    <h2 id="connectionModalTitle">Connect People</h2>
    <p id="connectionText">Person A is __ to Person B</p>
    <div class="connection-buttons">
      <button id="motherBtn" class="connection-btn">Mother</button>
      <button id="fatherBtn" class="connection-btn">Father</button>
      <button id="childBtn" class="connection-btn">Child</button>
      <button id="spouseBtn" class="connection-btn">Spouse</button>
      <button id="lineOnlyBtn" class="connection-btn line-only">Line only</button>
    </div>
    <button id="cancelConnectionModal">Cancel</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### JavaScript Implementation (`tree-core-canvas.js:1972-2085`)
- **Setup Function**: `setupConnectionModal()` - Initializes all event listeners
- **Modal Control**: `openConnectionModal()`, `closeConnectionModal()` - Handle visibility and state
- **Relationship Logic**: `createConnectionWithType(type)` - Creates appropriate relationships
- **Connection Types**: Supports all family relationship types plus visual-only connections
- **Data Integration**: Proper integration with existing person data and renderer systems

#### User Interaction Flow
1. **Selection**: User selects exactly 2 people on canvas
2. **Trigger**: "Link" button appears and user clicks it
3. **Modal Display**: Connection modal opens with personalized text
4. **Relationship Choice**: User selects relationship type (mother, father, child, spouse, line-only)
5. **Creation**: Appropriate relationship is created in family tree data
6. **Visual Update**: Canvas re-renders with new connection, auto-save triggers
7. **Notification**: Success message shows relationship created between named people

### Cache Indicator Smart Behavior (`builder.html:1015-1150`)

#### Enhanced Timer Management
- **Auto-Collapse**: 4-second timer when expanded, 2-second timer after input blur
- **Smart Clearing**: Timer cleared during any user interaction (hover, click, type, focus)
- **Event Prevention**: Input field interactions don't trigger parent element handlers
- **Hover Protection**: Mouse presence in expanded area prevents auto-collapse

#### Multi-Level Event Handling
```javascript
// Parent container - only responds to clicks on save indicator text
this.indicator.addEventListener('click', () => this.toggleExpand());

// Expanded content - prevents parent clicks, clears timer
expandedContent.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  this.clearCollapseTimer();
});

// Input field - comprehensive interaction handling
this.treeNameInput.addEventListener('input', () => this.clearCollapseTimer());
this.treeNameInput.addEventListener('focus', (e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  this.clearCollapseTimer();
});
```

## Core Architecture

### Module System
The application uses ES6 modules with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Engine**: `tree-core-canvas.js` (main controller), `canvas-renderer.js` (rendering)
- **Data Layer**: `core-cache.js` (auto-save), `core-undoRedo.js` (state management)
- **UI Layer**: `modal.js` (person editing), `table.js` (table view), `ui-*.js` (UI components)
- **Features**: `exporter.js` (multi-format export), `search.js`, `i18n.js` (internationalization)

### State Management
- Central state managed by `TreeCoreCanvas` class in `tree-core-canvas.js`
- Auto-save functionality saves to localStorage every 30 seconds
- Undo/redo system tracks state changes with configurable limits
- Observer pattern for state updates between modules
- **Data Format**: Only supports current JSON format (legacy format support removed)

### Canvas Rendering
- High-performance canvas-based family tree visualization
- Supports pan, zoom, drag operations with mobile optimization
- Multiple node styles (circle/rectangle) and connection line types
- Canvas renderer is initialized and managed by the core controller

## Key Features

- **Interactive Family Tree**: Canvas-based drag-and-drop interface
- **Person Management**: Comprehensive profiles with relationships
- **Dual Views**: Graphic (canvas) and table views with seamless switching
- **Export Options**: SVG, PNG, PDF, GEDCOM formats
- **Auto-save**: Automatic persistence to localStorage
- **Internationalization**: Support for EN, ES, RU, DE languages
- **Search**: Real-time family member search functionality
- **Undo/Redo**: Full state management for user actions
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Data Structure

Family tree data is stored as:
- **People array**: Each person object contains personal data and relationship IDs
- **Relationships**: Parent-child and spouse connections via person IDs
- **Display preferences**: Node styling, font settings, visibility options
- **Canvas state**: Pan, zoom, and layout information
- **Format**: JSON structure with version information for data validation

## CSS Architecture

### Main Stylesheets
- **`style.css`**: Core application styles (navigation, layout, forms, responsive design)
- **`modal.css`**: All modal-related styles (dialogs, overlays, form actions)
- **`homepage.css`**: Landing page specific styles (used only by index.html)

### Modal System
- All modal styles are now in `modal.css` for better organization
- Includes: modal containers, content, headers, form actions, responsive behavior
- Referenced in `builder.html` after main stylesheet for proper cascade

## Common Patterns

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use the EventBus system for module communication instead of window globals
2. **Security First**: Always use SecurityUtils for DOM manipulation and input sanitization
3. **Error Handling**: Use RetryManager for operations that might fail, comprehensive error recovery
4. **Dependency Injection**: Use the ServiceContainer pattern instead of direct imports where possible
5. **Data Validation**: Always validate data before processing or storage
6. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines, provide keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
7. **CSS Organization**: Keep modal styles in modal.css, main styles in style.css

## Data Format Standards

### Current JSON Format (Only Supported)
```javascript
{
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "cacheFormat": "enhanced",
  "persons": [...],
  "fontSettings": {...},
  "canvasState": {...}
}
```

### Data Validation
- All loaded data must include version or persons properties
- Unrecognized formats are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Auto-save only works with current format specifications

## New Architecture Examples

```javascript
// Use EventBus instead of window globals
import { appContext, EVENTS } from './event-bus.js';

// Emit events
appContext.getEventBus().emit(EVENTS.TREE_PERSON_ADDED, { person: personData });

// Listen for events
appContext.getEventBus().on(EVENTS.CANVAS_NODE_SELECTED, (data) => {
  console.log('Node selected:', data.nodeId);
});

// Use SecurityUtils for safe DOM manipulation
import { SecurityUtils, DOMUtils } from './security-utils.js';

// Safe text content
SecurityUtils.setTextContent(element, userInput);

// Safe element creation
const button = SecurityUtils.createElement('button', {
  className: 'btn-primary',
  'aria-label': 'Save family tree'
}, 'Save');

// Use RetryManager for operations that might fail
import { RetryManager } from './error-handling.js';

const result = await RetryManager.retry(async () => {
  return await riskyOperation();
}, {
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000
});
```

## Development Guidelines

### When Working with Modals
- Always add modal styles to `modal.css`, not `style.css`
- Test modal functionality across desktop and mobile devices
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Use existing modal patterns for consistency

### Data Handling
- Only process data that matches current JSON format
- Always validate data structure before processing
- Use appropriate error messages for invalid data
- Log warnings for unrecognized formats but don't attempt processing

### CSS Organization
- Main application styles go in `style.css`
- Modal-specific styles go in `modal.css`
- Homepage styles stay in `homepage.css`
- Maintain responsive design patterns across all stylesheets

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 13+, Chrome Mobile 80+
- **Features Used**: ES6 modules, Canvas API, localStorage, CSS Grid, Flexbox
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for older browsers where possible

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas rendering optimized for trees with 100+ people
- Auto-save throttled to prevent excessive localStorage writes
- Lazy loading for non-critical UI components
- Optimized CSS with minimal reflows and repaints
- Separate CSS files allow for better caching strategies

## Important Notes

- The application runs entirely client-side with no backend dependencies
- All data is stored in browser localStorage until explicitly exported
- Canvas rendering is optimized for performance with large family trees
- Internationalization uses JSON translation files in the `locales/` directory
- Export functionality supports industry-standard GEDCOM format for genealogy software compatibility
- **Legacy data formats are no longer supported** - only current JSON format is accepted
- Modal styles are separated for better maintainability and organization

## Testing Recommendations

When testing the application:
1. **Data Import**: Test only with current JSON format files
2. **Modal Functionality**: Verify all modals work correctly after CSS separation
3. **Responsive Design**: Test modal behavior on mobile devices
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful handling of invalid data formats
5. **Performance**: Test with large family trees (50+ people)
6. **Accessibility**: Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
